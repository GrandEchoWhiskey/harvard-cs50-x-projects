### Background:
DNA, the carrier of genetic information in living things, has been used in criminal justice for decades. But how, exactly, does DNA profiling work? Given a sequence of DNA, how can forensic investigators identify to whom it belongs?

Well, DNA is really just a sequence of molecules called nucleotides, arranged into a particular shape (a double helix). Every human cell has billions of nucleotides arranged in sequence. Each nucleotide of DNA contains one of four different bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T). Some portions of this sequence (i.e., genome) are the same, or at least very similar, across almost all humans, but other portions of the sequence have a higher genetic diversity and thus vary more across the population.

One place where DNA tends to have high genetic diversity is in Short Tandem Repeats (STRs). An STR is a short sequence of DNA bases that tends to repeat consecutively numerous times at specific locations inside of a person’s DNA. The number of times any particular STR repeats varies a lot among individuals. In the DNA samples below, for example, Alice has the STR `AGAT` repeated four times in her DNA, while Bob has the same STR repeated five times.

### Getting Started:
Export this directory using SVN.
```
svn export https://github.com/GrandEchoWhiskey/harvard-cs50-x-projects/trunk/pset-6-dna
```
Change directory
```
cd pset-6-dna
```
Now run the script
```
python dna.py DATABASE SEQUENCE
```
