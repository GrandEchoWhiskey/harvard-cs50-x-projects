### Background:

According to Scholastic, E.B. White’s Charlotte’s Web is between a second- and fourth-grade reading level, and Lois Lowry’s The Giver is between an eighth- and twelfth-grade reading level. What does it mean, though, for a book to be at a particular reading level?

Well, in many cases, a human expert might read a book and make a decision on the grade (i.e., year in school) for which they think the book is most appropriate. But an algorithm could likely figure that out too!

So what sorts of traits are characteristic of higher reading levels? Well, longer words probably correlate with higher reading levels. Likewise, longer sentences probably correlate with higher reading levels, too.

### Getting Started:
Export this directory using SVN.
```
svn export https://github.com/GrandEchoWhiskey/harvard-cs50-x-projects/trunk/pset-6-sentimental-readability
```
Change directory
```
cd pset-6-sentimental-readability
```
Now run the script
```
python readability.py
```
